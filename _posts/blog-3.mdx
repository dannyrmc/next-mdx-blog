This is a paragraph with a <Highlighter>highlighted section</Highlighter>. Despite our best efforts, we failed to steal the moon. Such brilliance is too elusive for one's mind. We have transcended beyond our own aspirations.

Venenatis adipiscing placerat neque velit mauris. Enim vitae consequat sed dictum id condimentum purus.

## Some Important Header

What follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense. <br/>It includes every sensible typographic like bold text, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, and even italics.

It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:

1. **List Header** \
   We want everything to look good out of the box.
2. **List Header** \
   Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.
3. **List Header** \
   Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more realistic than a list with two items.

Now we're going to try out another header style.

## Typography is Everything

```javascript
const Category = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="w-max rounded-3xl border border-border bg-muted px-3 py-2">
      <p className="text-sx font-playfair font-bold uppercase leading-3 tracking-widest text-foreground lg:text-sm">
        {props.category_label}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Category;
```

When a heading comes after a paragraph, we need a bit more space, like I already mentioned above. Now let's see what a more complex list would look like.

- **I often do this thing where list items have headings.** \
  For some reason I think this looks cool which is unfortunate because it's pretty annoying to get the styles right.

  I often have two or three paragraphs in these list items, too, so the hard part is getting the spacing between the paragraphs, list item heading, and separate list items to all make sense. 

- **Since this is a list, I need at least two items.** \
  I explained what I'm doing already in the previous list item, but a list wouldn't be a list if it only had one item, and we really want this to look realistic.

- **It's not a bad idea to add a third item either.** \
  I think it probably would've been fine to just use two items but three is definitely not worse, and since I seem to be having no trouble making up arbitrary things to type, I might as well include it. I'm going to press <kbd>Shift</kbd> now.

I'll see myself out.
