Unplug for a few moments. Listen to the kettle boil. Smell the grind. Let coffee become more than caffeine—let it become a daily intention.

Let's walk through how you can build a better start to your day—with just a few simple steps and tools.

## What You'll Need

Here's a quick list of essentials that make a difference:

1. A burr grinder
2. A scale
3. Your favorite brewing method (e.g., pour-over, French press, AeroPress)
4. Fresh whole beans
5. Hot water (ideally around 200°F)

## The 5-Minute Ritual

Creating your own ritual doesn't have to be complicated. Try the following steps:

- Grind fresh beans just before brewing
- Pre-wet your filter (if applicable)
- Bloom your grounds to release CO₂
- Pour in a slow, circular motion
- Take a moment to inhale the aroma

If you're short on time, consider brewing a small batch using an AeroPress. It's fast, portable, and still delivers great taste.

> “The smell of fresh-made coffee is one of the world's greatest inventions.”  

## Experiment with Flavor

Trying different beans is a fun way to explore your preferences. Start with a light roast and take notes on taste, aroma, and aftertaste.

```javascript
const Category = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="w-max rounded-3xl border border-border bg-muted px-3 py-2">
      <p className="text-sx font-playfair font-bold uppercase leading-3 tracking-widest text-foreground lg:text-sm">
        {props.category_label}
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Category;
```

That's a simplified <InlineCode>Category</InlineCode> tag component—perfect for organizing your tasting notes on a personal coffee blog.
